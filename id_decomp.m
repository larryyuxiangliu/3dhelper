% Given an input matrix A, this function determines an index 
% vector I and a "coefficient matrix" T such that
%
%   A(:,I) \approx A(:,I(1:k))*[I,T]
%
% The function has two modes of operating:
%
% (1) If the second input is smaller than 1, then the function
%     determines the rank k adaptively to precision acc=INPUT2
%
% (2) If the second input is larger than of equal to 1, then it
%     sets k = INPUT2 
%
% In addition, there are two modes of computing:
%
% flag_mode='MAT'    This uses Matlab's built-in function qr.
%                    This is sometimes very fast due to the efficient implementation.
%                    It is sometimes very wasteful, though, since the full
%                    decomposition (to rank min(m,n)) is computed.
%
% flag_mode='PGS'    This forces column pivoted Gram-Schmidt to compute the skeleton.
%                    This usually gives better skeletons but can be slow.
%
% NOTE: If possible, a mex-file verion of "id_decomp" should be used!
%       The only purpose of the present routine is for convenience to avoid 
%       having to compile the mex-file (this is _very_ system dependent).
